			<p>My asteroid game is a simple but fun 2D space shooter built with JavaScript and the 
				Canvas API. The player controls a spaceship that moves up and down while shooting 
				bullets to destroy incoming asteroids.</p> 
				
				<p>They spawn from the right side at random speeds 
				and sizes, and if one hits the player, the game resets. There's basic collision detection 
				for both the player and bullets, a score system, and a game loop that handles starting, 
				playing, and game over states. </p> 
				
				<p>The asteroid spawner keeps things dynamic, 
				making for a fast-paced and replayable arcade-style experience.</p>
